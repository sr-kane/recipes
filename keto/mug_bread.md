For 1 serving using almond flour: 315 calories / 29g fat / 4.7g carbs / 2g fiber / 11g protein
For 1 serving using coconut flour: 235 calories / 20g fat / 5.7 carbs / 3g fiber / 8g protein
Tap the container on the counter a few times to remove any air bubbles before you cook it
You could really use any nut flour that you want if you are allergic to almonds or coconut.  For alternative nut flours like pecan four, you would use 3 tbsp.  You use half the amount for coconut flour because it's not really a nut and it is very absorbent!
I found that a 4x4 microwave safe container made the perfect size piece of low carb bread that could be cut in half and stuffed with all the things
You could also use a round container that is 4 inches in diameter for a keto mug bread
If you would rather bake this in the oven, you can use an oven safe container and bake at 375 for 10 minutes
Toasting this low carb bread makes it have a much better texture.  you could also use a skillet to toast it in some butter.  Yum!
