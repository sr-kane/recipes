## Muffin Ingredients

| Amount | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 1/4 cup | almond flour (25 g / 0.9 oz) |
| 1/4 cup | flaxmeal (38 g / 1.3 oz) |
| 1/4 tsp | baking soda |
| 1 | large egg, free-range or organic |
| 2 tbsp | heavy whipping cream or coconut milk |
| 2 tbsp | water |
| 1/4 | cup grated cheddar cheese (28 g / 1 oz) |
| pinch | salt (I like pink Himalayan) |

## Instructions

1. Place all the dry ingredients in a small bowl and combine well.
2. Add the egg, cream, water and mix well using a fork.
3. Grate the cheese and add it to the mixture. Combine well and place in single-serving ramekins.
4. Microwave on high for 60-90 seconds.
5. Cut the muffins in half and spread some butter on the inside of each of the halves.
6. Top each with slices of cheese, egg and mustard. Optionally, serve with greens (lettuce, spinach, watercress, chard, etc.) and bacon.

## Tips
* The muffins (without the filling) can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
* Tips for cooking in the oven: If you don't have a microwave, I suggest you make 4-8 servings at once. Preheat the oven to 175 C / 350 F and cook for about 12-15 minutes or until cooked in the centre.
