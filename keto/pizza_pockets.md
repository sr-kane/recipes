## Net Carb

* filling + 4g per pocket (recipe makes dough for 4 pockets)

## Ingredients

Mozzarella Dough

| Quantity | Measurement |
| --- | --- |
| 170 g | pre shredded/grated cheese mozzarella |
| 85 g | almond meal/flour |
| 2 tbsp | cream cheese full fat |
| 1 | egg medium |
| pinch | salt to taste |

## Instructions

1. Mix the shredded/grated cheese and almond flour/meal in a microwaveable bowl. Add the cream cheese. Microwave on HIGH for 1 minute.
2. Stir then microwave on HIGH for another 30 seconds.
3. Add the egg, salt and mix gently.
4. Roll the keto cheese dough between 2 pieces of baking parchment/paper. Do not roll as thin as a thin pizza crust. It needs to be a little thicker so it is sturdy and will hold the pizza filings. 
5. Remove the top baking paper/parchment.  Cut the dough into squares the same size as your toasted sandwich maker. 
6. Place one square on the bottom of the sandwich maker, add your choice of  fillings, place another square of dough on the top, press the lid of the sandwich maker down and cook for 3-5 minutes until golden.

## Recipe Notes
